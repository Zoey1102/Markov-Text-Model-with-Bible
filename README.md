# Project Overview
Apply Markov text model to analyse the Gutenberg Bible (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible), main code in coursework_refined.R. 

We write a Markov chain text generator to emulate the Gutenberg Bible to see if the sentence generated thereby could be distinguished by the computer afterwards.
